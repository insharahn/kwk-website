# Generational Gains: A Scrollytelling Project on Black Homeownership & Wealth

This project is part of the Kode With Klossy Data Storytelling Challenge.

## Accessibility Highlights

This project was built to be inclusive and usable for as many people as possible. It includes:

- Semantic HTML structure and hidden screen reader headings (`aria-labelledby`)
- Descriptive ARIA labels for dynamic content and charts
- Color palette chosen to be colorblind-friendly (based on Paul Tolâ€™s Bright palette!)
- Figcaptions, detailed axis labels, and data source notes for all charts
- Smooth scroll-triggered content reveals designed to respect motion preferences
